# Version History in Word Processor

Document versioning is the systematic management of document changes, allowing users to track, compare, and revert to previous iterations of a document. It involves the creation of multiple versions of a document, each representing a snapshot of its content at a specific point in time. Versioning in Word Processor requires client-side and server-side changes, please find the details in the below link
